  <h1>Privacy Policy â€“ Phenologger</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18.07.2025</p>

  <p>Phenologger is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information from users of the Phenologger mobile application ("the App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>

  <h2>1.1 Location Metadata in Photos and Videos</h2>
  <p>
  If you select a photo or video from your deviceâ€™s gallery, Phenologger may request permission to read any location (GPS) information embedded in the fileâ€™s metadata (EXIF data). This is used only to tag your observation with the original capture location, which may differ from your current location. If permission is denied or the file contains no location data, you will be able to set a location manually or use your deviceâ€™s current location.
  </p>
  <p>
  Phenologger does not share or sell location metadata from your media. This information is stored securely and used solely for the purpose of accurately tagging your observation.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <li>To manage your observations and display personalized maps/trends.</li>
    <li>To improve the app and analyze data for scientific relevance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No personal data is sold or shared. Anonymous observation data may be used for science or education.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All data is securely stored in Firebase. We take reasonable steps to protect it.</p>
